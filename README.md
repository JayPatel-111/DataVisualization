<h1>Data Visualization Using BigMart Data</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I am conducting an analysis of the Big Mart sales data using various Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn. By utilizing these powerful tools, my objective is to gain valuable insights into the dataset and uncover patterns and trends.

The first plot I generated is a bar plot illustrating the mean sales for each outlet type. The x-axis represents the different types of outlets, namely Small, Medium, and High, while the y-axis represents the mean sales. This plot provides an overview of the average sales for each outlet type, allowing me to compare their performance.

Moving on, the second plot is a scatter plot that displays the relative distribution of item weight and item visibility. Each point on the plot represents an item in the dataset, with the x-axis representing the item weight and the y-axis representing the item visibility. This plot helps me visualize the relationship between item weight and visibility, giving me insights into how these variables are distributed and whether there are any noticeable patterns or correlations.

Lastly, the third plot is a box plot created using the seaborn library, focusing on the variable "Item_Outlet_Sales." This plot represents the distribution of sales data, showing the median, quartiles, and any outliers present in the dataset. By analyzing this box plot, I can understand the spread and skewness of the sales data, as well as identify any potential outliers that might require further investigation.

Overall, these plots provide valuable insights into the Big Mart sales data. The first plot showcases the average sales for different outlet types, allowing me to compare their performances. The second plot helps me understand the relationship between item weight and visibility. Finally, the third plot summarizes the distribution of item outlet sales, shedding light on any anomalies or outliers in the data. These visualizations are crucial in uncovering patterns, trends, and outliers, ultimately aiding in a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
